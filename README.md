# Question: How can you validate if a Sudoku board is valid according to the rules? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript function `isValidSudoku(board)` validates if a given Sudoku board adheres to the game's rules. It creates three arrays, `rows`, `columns`, and `boxes`, each containing nine sets. These sets are used to store the unique numbers in each row, column, and 3x3 box of the Sudoku board. The function then iterates over each cell in the board. If the cell contains a number (not '.'), it calculates the index of the 3x3 box that the cell belongs to. It then checks if the number already exists in the corresponding row, column, or box. If the number is found, the function immediately returns false, indicating that the board is not valid. If the number is not found, it is added to the appropriate sets. If the function successfully iterates over all cells without finding any duplicates, it returns true, indicating that the board is valid. The Sudoku board is provided as a hardcoded 9x9 array, but this can be replaced with any other 9x9 array.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution is more structured and object-oriented than the JavaScript version. It uses a class `SudokuValidator` to encapsulate the Sudoku board and the validation methods. This makes the code more modular and easier to understand and maintain.

In terms of language features, TypeScript introduces static types, which are not present in JavaScript. In the TypeScript version, the type of the Sudoku board is explicitly declared as a 2D array of numbers (`number[][]`). The return types of the methods are also explicitly declared (`boolean`). This can help prevent bugs and make the code easier to understand.

The TypeScript version also uses a different representation for the Sudoku board. Instead of using strings and the '.' character to represent empty cells, it uses numbers and the 0 value. This makes the code slightly simpler and more efficient, as comparing and working with numbers is generally faster than with strings.

The logic of the two versions is essentially the same. They both use sets to keep track of the numbers in each row, column, and box, and they both return false as soon as a duplicate number is found. However, the TypeScript version breaks down the validation into separate methods for rows, columns, and boxes, which makes the code more modular and easier to follow.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution uses a similar approach to the JavaScript version, but with some differences due to the language features and syntax.

1. Data Structures: In JavaScript, the solution uses the Set data structure to keep track of the numbers in each row, column, and box. In C++, there is no direct equivalent to JavaScript's Set, so the solution uses 2D arrays instead. The value at each index in these arrays represents whether a certain number is present in the corresponding row, column, or box.

2. Array Initialization: In JavaScript, the solution initializes the sets with the Array.fill() and Array.map() methods. In C++, the solution initializes the arrays with zero values using the {0} syntax.

3. Character to Integer Conversion: In JavaScript, the solution directly uses the character from the board as the number. In C++, the solution subtracts '0' from the character to convert it to an integer.

4. Looping: Both solutions use nested for loops to iterate over the board. However, in C++, the solution uses the size() method to get the size of the board and each row, while in JavaScript, the solution uses the fixed size 9.

5. Checking and Updating: In JavaScript, the solution uses the Set.has() method to check if a number is already present, and the Set.add() method to add a new number. In C++, the solution uses array indexing to check and update the presence of a number.

6. Output: In JavaScript, the solution uses console.log() to output the result. In C++, the solution uses std::cout to output the result.
